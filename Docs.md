    3)Part three:

    4)Part four:
        -I didn't do this part as I couldn't find the react diagrams library you're refering to as there
        is many libraries and I searched through many of them. I had to usd this one because it's the simplest
        to learn and use, regarding to the limited time I have for this test.
